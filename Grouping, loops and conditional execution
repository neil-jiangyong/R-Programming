Conditional execution: if statements

The language has available a conditional construction of the form

> if (expr_1) expr_2 else expr_3

There is also a for loop construction which has the form

> for (name in expr_1) expr_2

Other looping facilities include the

> repeat expr
statement and the

> while (condition) expr
statement.

The break statement can be used to terminate any loop, possibly abnormally. This is the only way to terminate repeat loops.

The next statement can be used to discontinue one particular cycle and skip to the “next”.
